What kind of role I was looking for?
I fumbled a little here..said I trained in full-stack and I was looking for a small team with more responsibility and 
more visibility in web development. I think I hesitated because I want to work on FrontEnd and the job is BackEnd and 
the I am familiar with their Tech Stack but not as proficient as with Rails. 
Need to come up with a better answer than that.

If I have worked in a bigger organization ever?
Told that worked with 13 people team and 500 people business unit.
I should have said that there was a lot of overlap and it was quite common that the resources were borrowed by different teams 
so I worked with different teams as well as vendors like Synopsys and Cadence.

Told a lot about Resource
I think I was engaged and listening carefully, asked questions at the right places and phrased answers in my words. Asked 
clarifying questions when I didn't understand something.
Asked additional relevant questions.

Closing question:
Did you have any concern about my profile?
HE was concerned about whether I can pick new technology fast and wear different hats?
