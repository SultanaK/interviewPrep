# interviewPrep
# Coding Round : Screenshare ( I picked javascript for this)
* Design a class to implement Spreadsheet. It takes in number of rows and columns and has two methods
 update and
eg.
Alice|5|foo
Bob|10|
||
||
* pretty_print - Left aligned, dynamically assigned width
Alice |5 |foo
Bob   |10|

# Short conceptual questions: VERBAL
System Level
* What is a mutex
* What is deadlock
* What are reader/writer locks
Data structures
## Hashes and Maps
* How are they implemented
* What are collisions
* If you have 64000 values getting stored using a hash function that has 64 possible outputs, how would you store them.
* What is Bloom Filter
* How do we store passwords in tables
* What is hashing and salting
* Where is salt value stored
https://brilliant.org/wiki/bloom-filter/
* Binary Search Trees
* Search time Big O, Worst case search time
* How to you find kth smallest element ( preorder traversal?)
* How is preorder traversal implemented ( I tried to explain it but found it hard to do it verbally probably because I didn't remember the algorithm very well)
# Debugging Round: Screenshare ( I picked Ruby for this)
Find bugs in Web Crawler. They provided nice specs for it.
Make sure to run passing specs after each fix, it's possible to fail passing specs while you THINK you fixed the failing specs ( which would be awful).
# System Architecture :VERBAL
HTTP
Difference between GET and POST requests


 Q. A colleague has given you data scraped from Craigslist on used cars.
It contains data about many million cars and has their make, model, color, miles, location etc.
You have to design a system that would query the data and return the details about cars. What would be the API endpoints of this system?
Example - All the red hondas, between 30000 - 50000 miles located in Baltimore.
