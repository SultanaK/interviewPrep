Q 1. Ada Lovelace day 

Ada Lovelace day is celebrated on 2nd Tuesday of every Oct.
If an year is given as input, write a function to find the day in Oct when Ada Lovelace day will fall.

e.g.
Input : 2019
Output: 8  //2nd tuesday is on Oct 8th

Q 2. Move the zero

You are given an NXM matrix which is populated by numbers from 0..(nXm - 1)
  - input is reasonable ( no duplicates, no blank spaces etc)
  -the goal is to keep swapping zero with the adjacent elements ( only on the side or top/bottom, not diagonals) until all the following conditions are met:
      a) zero reaches at matrix[0][0]
      b) all the numbers are lesser than the numbers to their right ( in the same row)
      c) all the numbers are lesser than the numbers below them ( in the same column
      
  -output is the minimum number of moves to achieve this.
  
  Matrix can't be smaller than [2 X 2] can't be bigger than [5x5]
