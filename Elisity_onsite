It took place on 12/5 

Round 1 - Interview with Founder

Tell me about yourself.
What kind of job you are looking for next?
Why join a startup? Why not Google/Amazon - easy money?
Asked me about the company I founded. 
   -Did you have a business background?
   -What is the plan for the company going forward?
Asked me about my family
   - What does your husband do?
   - How old are the kids?
   - How far do you live from here?
He explained that he didn't mean to pry but was trying to understand what my risk taking capacity is at the moment.


Round 2 - Interview with Frontend Engineer
(This interview wasn't scheduled originally, so the engineer got pulled from her work and asked to interview me at the spur of the moment. She was also working on a tight schedule for her deliverables, apparently. She mentioned that her questions were haphazard because of that reason)

I made a functional component and was asked to change to a class based component
